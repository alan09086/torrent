All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## 0.67.0 — M61 Performance Optimizations

### Performance
- **O(1) pending request lookup** — replaced `PeerState.pending_requests: Vec<(u32, u32, u32)>` with `PendingRequests` newtype wrapping `FxHashMap<(u32, u32), u32>`. Eliminates O(128) linear scan on every block received (~6000/sec). 4 call sites converted from `.iter().position()` + `.swap_remove()` to `.remove(index, begin)`.
- **End-game cascade eliminated** — removed reactive re-requesting loop that triggered 50 picker invocations per block in end-game mode. Replaced with a 200ms periodic batch refill tick (`end_game_tick_interval`) with `MissedTickBehavior::Skip` to prevent burst-fire on activation. All peers with available pipeline slots refilled in a single pass.
- **END_GAME_DEPTH raised 4 → 128** — matches normal-mode pipeline depth. With depth 4, each peer only had 64KB queued (6.4ms of work at 10 MB/s), idling 97% of the time between refill ticks. With depth 128, each peer has 2MB queued (200ms of work), fully utilising the 200ms tick interval. Eliminates `final_speed=0.0 MB/s` tail stall observed in all v0.66.0 benchmark trials.
- **In-flight piece cap** — new `max_in_flight_pieces` setting (default 32) bounds store buffer memory at the piece selector level. When the cap is reached, Layers 3 (suggested) and 5 (new piece) are skipped — only partial/steal paths remain active. Memory bound: 32 × 512KB = 16 MiB for typical torrents (was unbounded).

### Added
- `benchmarks/build_report.py` — generates versioned markdown benchmark reports from CSV data
- `benchmarks/generate_report.sh` — orchestrates benchmark summarization and report generation
- `--json` output mode for `benchmarks/summarize.py`
- `docs/benchmark-report-v0.66.0.md` — baseline benchmark report
- `PendingRequests` newtype with full API: `new()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `contains()`, `len()`, `is_empty()`, `clear()`, `iter()`
- `max_in_flight_pieces` setting in `Settings` and `TorrentConfig` (default: 32)
- `cap_reached` field in `PickContext` for piece selector backpressure
- Test count: 1390

## 0.66.0 — Performance Consistency & Tuning

### Fixed
- **Store buffer race causing hash verification failures** — `store_buffer.remove()` was called inside a spawned blocking task, creating a race window where `on_piece_hash_failed()` could trigger re-download and write new blocks before the verify task consumed the old ones, producing "frankenstein pieces" that mixed data from different download attempts (thousands of hash failures per download). Fix: extract blocks synchronously before spawning. Also added `sha1_chunks()`/`sha256_chunks()` for incremental hashing, eliminating ~512KB concatenation allocation per piece verification. Before: 235-300s (4-5 MB/s); After: 35-49s (35-54 MB/s)
- **Store buffer lock scope** — made Mutex lock scope explicit in verify path with block scope, preventing potential contention between enqueue_write and spawn_blocking verify tasks
- **Pipeline fill loop peer validation** — peer existence check and bitfield refresh each iteration of the pick_blocks loop, preventing stale context from causing wasted block picks
- **Disconnect handler re-request guard** — defensive peer existence check before re-requesting blocks from remaining peers after a disconnect
- **Event loop stalls from blocking sends** — all peer channel sends in TorrentActor converted from `.send().await` to `try_send()`, preventing the actor event loop from freezing when any peer channel is full
- **Duplicate block handling** — `handle_piece_data` now returns early when a block was already received, preventing wasted disk writes and double-counting
- **DHT stalled lookups** — `get_peers` queries now advance on timeout instead of stalling; query expiry logging added
- **DHT BEP42 node sorting** — routing table now sorts by XOR distance for correct closest-node selection; all-K parallel `get_peers` queries for faster peer discovery
- **DHT timeout** — reduced from 10s to 5s for faster peer discovery
- **Shutdown hang** — `shutdown_peers()` converted peer shutdown from blocking `.send().await` to `try_send()`; `announce_stopped()` wrapped in 3s timeout; `TorrentHandle::shutdown()` and `SessionHandle::shutdown()` wrapped in 5s/10s timeouts

### Performance
- **Actor CPU overhead reduced** — six targeted optimizations to `request_pieces_from_peer()` and the event loop: skip picker call for duplicate blocks, cache peer_rates on actor (refresh on 1s tick), clone peer bitfield once before picker loop, use `Lengths::chunks_in_piece()` arithmetic instead of iterating chunk tracker, batch-drain up to 64 peer events per `select!` iteration, share single `Instant::now()` call. CPU usage reduced from 3.3x to 1.83x vs rqbit. Before: ~26s user CPU, ~47 MB/s peak; After: ~12.6s user CPU, ~78.5 MB/s peak; rqbit: ~6.9s user CPU, ~105 MB/s peak

### Changed
- **Parallel tracker announces** — all tracker announces now fire concurrently via `tokio::task::JoinSet` instead of sequentially. Time-to-first-piece reduced from `sum(tracker_timeouts)` to `max(tracker_timeouts)`
- **Fixed permit pipeline model** — replaced EWMA-computed queue depth with fixed 128 permits (rqbit model). `queue_depth()` is now constant — zero-latency scheduling with no negative feedback loops
- **End-game pipelining** — end-game mode now sends up to 4 requests per peer (was 1), eliminating the 128x pipeline depth reduction that caused last-3% slowdowns
- **Reactive end-game cancel re-requesting** — when a block is received and duplicate requests are cancelled, freed peers immediately get new end-game blocks instead of waiting for the next tick
- **Snub timeout reduced 60s to 15s** — stalled peers now free their 128 request slots 4x faster; rqbit handles this in ~10s
- **Peer turnover increased from 4%/300s to 8%/120s** — underperforming peers cycled 4x faster (~120 replacements/hour)
- **Zombie peer pruning** — peers with empty bitfields after 30s are disconnected during choking evaluation to free connection slots (only during downloading, not seeding)
- Test count: 1386

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 1.5 GiB, 5 trials)
| Client | Time (s) | CPU (s) | Speed (MB/s) | RSS (MiB) |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| torrent 0.66.0 | 100.3 ±19.3 | 37.1 ±4.7 | 15.0 ±3.5 | 170.2 ±42.9 |
| rqbit 8.1.1 | 34.4 ±24.1 | 10.4 ±0.6 | 56.7 ±27.0 | 37.5 ±3.9 |
| qbittorrent 5.1.4 | 51.5 ±10.7 | 18.1 ±2.5 | 29.1 ±5.3 | 1525.5 ±5.5 |

**Identified bottlenecks for M68:** end-game pipeline depth too shallow (4 vs 128), O(n) linear scans in pending_requests, redundant bitfield clones in hot path, reactive re-requesting triggers 2+ full picker cycles per block, peer_count() does O(n log n) sort per invocation, unbounded store buffer memory

## 0.65.0 — `torrent` v0.65.0: Rename, Non-Blocking Pipeline, Production Hardening

### Breaking
- **Workspace renamed from `ferrite` to `torrent`** — all 12 crates renamed: `ferrite-*` → `torrent-*`. Update your `Cargo.toml` dependencies and `use` imports accordingly.
- Version bumped 0.64.0 → 0.65.0

### Added
- crates.io metadata: keywords, categories, homepage, documentation URLs
- `rust-version = "1.85"` MSRV set for all publishable crates
- Non-blocking disk writes and async piece verification (M58 pipeline re-applied)
- O(1) peer dedup via `HashSet<SocketAddr>` in `handle_add_peers()`
- Criterion benchmarks for bencode parsing and piece hashing
- `rustfmt.toml` with workspace-wide formatting rules
- Workspace-level clippy lint configuration
- Resource exhaustion limits: `max_metadata_size`, `max_message_size`, `max_piece_length`, `max_outstanding_requests`
- `cargo-fuzz` scaffolding with 4 fuzz targets (bencode, peer_wire, tracker, metadata)
- Architecture documentation (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/security.md`)

### Changed
- CLI binary renamed from `ferrite` to `torrent`
- `torrent-cli` marked `publish = false`
- Test count: 1378+

## 0.64.0 — TCP Listener, UPnP Gateway Probe & Log Cleanup

### Fixed
- **TCP listener for incoming peer connections** — `SessionActor` only had uTP and SSL listeners, never binding a plain TCP accept loop on the main listen port. Incoming TCP connections were refused, preventing peers from connecting to us. Added TCP listener bind, generalized `identify_plaintext_connection` to any `AsyncRead+AsyncWrite` stream, and unified routing via `route_inbound_stream<S>`
- **UPnP discovery with gateway probe fallback** — many consumer routers have broken SSDP (don't respond to multicast M-SEARCH) but serve valid UPnP descriptions over HTTP. Added fallback that probes the default gateway on common UPnP ports (49152, 5000, 5431, 2869, 49153) and description paths (`/rootDesc.xml`, `/gatedesc.xml`, etc.)
- **UPnP IGD v2 support** — SSDP now sends both v1 and v2 M-SEARCH, and service type search includes `WANIPConnection:2` alongside v1 and `WANPPPConnection:1` (PPPoE)
- **SSDP response filtering** — discovery loop now skips non-IGD responders (e.g. Plex DLNA servers) and accepts only `InternetGatewayDevice` matches
- **Log spam reduced** — demoted routine peer churn events (uTP max timeouts, wire errors, send errors) from `warn!` to `debug!`

### Changed
- `identify_plaintext_connection` generalized from `UtpStream`-specific to generic `S: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin + Send`
- `TorrentCommand::IncomingPeer` now carries `BoxedStream` instead of `PrefixedStream<UtpStream>`
- `BoxedStream` now implements `Debug`
- Test count: 1378

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 1.5 GiB, with UPnP port mapping)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Peak 5s speed | 56.0 MB/s |
| Average speed | 29.4 MB/s |
| Peak unchoked | 156 peers |
| Total peers | 200 |

## 0.63.1 — Settings Wiring & Throughput Fixes

### Fixed
- **13 TorrentConfig fields now wired from Settings** — `upload_rate_limit`, `download_rate_limit`, `strict_end_game`, `max_web_seeds`, `initial_picker_threshold`, `whole_pieces_threshold`, `snub_timeout_secs`, `readahead_pieces`, and `streaming_timeout_escalation` were hardcoded in `From<&Settings>`, silently ignoring user configuration
- **4 new TorrentConfig fields** — `storage_mode`, `block_request_timeout_secs`, `enable_lsd`, `force_proxy` now flow from Settings to per-torrent config
- **Storage mode wired to disk** — `FilesystemStorage::new()` preallocate parameter now respects `StorageMode::Full` instead of always being `false`
- **MSE PadB handling** — VC scan was broken for all real peers (desynchronized RC4 cipher on unencrypted padding)
- **uTP ext type 3** — libtorrent close_reason extension caused parse failures

### Performance
- **TorrentActor unblocked** — all peer command broadcasts converted from `.send().await` (blocking) to `try_send()` (non-blocking), preventing deadlocks on bounded channels
- **Phantom block assignments eliminated** — `assigned_blocks.insert()` moved after `try_send().is_ok()`, preventing permanent piece stalls when send fails
- **Snub detection** — peers marked as snubbed after 60s of no data while unchoked, freeing their assigned blocks
- **Pipeline tick** — `PeerPipelineState::tick()` now called every 1s for EWMA throughput updates

### Added
- 7 new Settings fields: `strict_end_game`, `max_web_seeds`, `initial_picker_threshold`, `whole_pieces_threshold`, `snub_timeout_secs`, `readahead_pieces`, `streaming_timeout_escalation`
- Regression test with non-default Settings values to prevent re-hardcoding

### Changed
- Test count: 1376 (was under-reported as 1153 due to `--fail-fast` hiding 4 crates behind pre-existing sim test failure)

## 0.63.0 — M56: Speed Optimization

### Added
- **DHT routing table persistence** — saves DHT routing table nodes on shutdown and reloads on startup for instant peer discovery (eliminates cold-start penalty)
- **Piece stealing** — faster peers steal in-flight blocks from peers running at less than 1/10th their download rate (configurable `steal_threshold_ratio`, default 10.0)
- **`initial_queue_depth`** setting — configurable per-peer initial request pipeline depth (default: 128, embedded: 16, high_performance: 256)
- **`steal_threshold_ratio`** setting — configurable steal aggressiveness (default: 10.0, high_performance: 5.0)
- **`dht_saved_nodes`** runtime field — builder API for injecting saved DHT nodes before session start

### Changed
- **Initial pipeline queue depth** raised from 2 to 128 per peer — matches rqbit's semaphore-permit model for faster ramp-up
- **PeerState::new()** now accepts configurable pipeline parameters instead of hardcoded values
- **Session state** now populates `dht_nodes` field (previously always empty `Vec::new()`)

### CLI
- **DHT state persistence** — `ferrite download` saves/loads DHT routing table to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ferrite/session.dat` across runs

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 1.42 GiB, 3 trials)
| Client | Time (s) | Speed (MB/s) | RSS (MiB) |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| ferrite | 96.8 ±1.1 | 15.0 ±0.2 | 29.3 ±0.9 |
| rqbit | 17.1 ±0.6 | 84.9 ±2.8 | 42.3 ±1.7 |
| libtorrent | 32.7 ±0.7 | 44.4 ±0.9 | 1487.8 ±0.1 |

**Note:** No speed improvement observed — the primary bottleneck is in the transfer pipeline itself (not peer discovery, queue depth, or block assignment). DHT persistence saves 40 nodes per session. Further investigation needed for M57.

## 0.62.0 — M55: Download Speed Optimization

### Changed
- **Immediate peer connection** — DHT, PEX, tracker, and manually-added peers now trigger `try_connect_peers()` immediately instead of waiting up to 30s for the periodic connect timer
- **Raised default max_peers** from 50 to 200 per torrent
- **Reduced connect_interval** from 30s to 5s for faster catch-up on edge cases
- **`max_peers_per_torrent`** now configurable in Settings (default: 200, embedded: 30, high_performance: 500)

### Fixed
- **CLI: FilesystemStorage** — `ferrite download` was passing `None` for storage, causing the session to use MemoryStorage (in-RAM only). Now creates proper FilesystemStorage from torrent metadata.

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 1.42 GiB, 3 trials)
| Client | Time (s) | Speed (MB/s) | RSS (MiB) |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| ferrite | 87.7 ±3.6 | 16.6 ±0.7 | 27.6 ±0.8 |
| rqbit | 17.8 ±0.9 | 81.5 ±3.9 | 40.6 ±0.9 |
| libtorrent | 37.1 ±29.9 | 58.2 ±37.9 | 1487.1 ±0.3 |

**Note:** Remaining speed gap is due to DHT cold-start (no routing table persistence). See M56 roadmap.

## 0.61.0 — M54: CLI Binary & Benchmarking

- **Piece queries**: `have_piece`, `piece_availability`, `file_progress` with byte-accurate file-piece overlap
- **Identity queries**: `info_hashes`, `torrent_file`, `torrent_file_v2` (None for magnets before metadata)
- **Force announce**: `force_dht_announce` (dual-swarm v4/v6), `force_lsd_announce` (session-level)
- **Disk operations**: `read_piece` → `Bytes`, `flush_cache` with `DiskJob::FlushAll`
- **Niche operations**: `is_valid` (synchronous), `clear_error` (auto-resume), `file_status`, `connect_peer`
