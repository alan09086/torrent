## [Unreleased]

## [0.106.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Peer scoring system** — composite score from 4 weighted signals: bandwidth (0.40), RTT (0.20), reliability (0.25), and availability (0.15). Pure `compute_score()` function with per-component normalisation, snub short-circuit (score = 0.0), and `build_swarm_context()` for O(n) median via `select_nth_unstable`.
- **Phase-aware turnover** — `SwarmPhase::Discovery` (first 60s, 30s churn interval, 10% eviction) and `SwarmPhase::Steady` (after 60s, 120s interval, 5% eviction). Adaptive dampening halves churn when median score > 0.7.
- **Score-based admission** — when at connection capacity, `try_connect_peers()` evicts the worst-scoring non-probation peer below `min_score_threshold` to make room for new candidates.
- **Hybrid snub eviction** — snubbed peers below threshold are evicted immediately on the 1s turnover tick (fast-path), while scoring handles non-snubbed underperformers through regular churn cycles.
- **Probation window** — newly connected peers are exempt from scoring and eviction for `probation_duration_secs` (default: 20s), scored at 0.5 during that window.
- **RTT tracking** — EWMA RTT captured from `pipeline.block_received()` return value (alpha=0.3), stored per-peer as `avg_rtt`.
- **`disconnect_peer()` DRY helper** — consolidated peer disconnect/cleanup pattern (super-seed, end-game, slab, piece_owner, availability, shutdown, alert) from 3+ call sites into one method.
- 7 new configuration settings: `probation_duration_secs`, `discovery_phase_secs`, `discovery_churn_interval_secs`, `discovery_churn_percent`, `steady_churn_interval_secs`, `steady_churn_percent`, `min_score_threshold`.
- 20 new tests (12 unit + 8 integration). 1581 total.

### Changed

- **Turnover timer** — changed from configurable `peer_turnover_interval`-based to unconditional 1s tick gated by `should_churn()`.
- **Snub handling** — reverted M104 immediate disconnect; snub detection still sets `peer.snubbed = true` but cleanup is handled by the scoring system.

### Removed

- `peer_turnover`, `peer_turnover_cutoff`, `peer_turnover_interval` settings (replaced by 7 scoring settings).
- `run_peer_turnover()` function (replaced by `run_scored_turnover()`).

## [0.105.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Configurable routing table node cap** — `max_nodes` setting (default 512) prevents
  unbounded routing table growth
- **Two-phase ping frequency** — 5s pings during bootstrap, 60s after stable (12x
  reduction in steady-state DHT traffic)
- **Background DNS bootstrap backoff** — DNS resolution spawned as background tasks with
  exponential backoff (1s→30s, 120s deadline), Phase 3 connect interval starts immediately
  without waiting for DNS
- **JSON routing table persistence** — actor-owned save/load with atomic writes
  (temp file + rename), 60s save interval
- 17 new tests (1565 total)

### Changed
- **Unified iterative lookup** — `IterativeLookup<C>` generic replaces duplicated
  `LookupState` and `FindNodeLookup` implementations (~90 lines removed)

## [0.104.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- **`fixed_pipeline_depth` setting** — new session setting (default: 128) for A/B
  benchmarking of per-peer pipeline depth
- **DHT diagnostic logging** — ~10 structured log lines at bootstrap stages (saved
  nodes, DNS resolution, node-count gate, timeout, get_peers) for cold-start failure
  diagnosis
- **Per-peer exponential backoff** — 200ms × 2^attempt (capped at 30s) prevents
  hammering peers that repeatedly fail to connect

### Changed
- **AIMD pipeline removed** — replaced dynamic AIMD queue depth (additive increase /
  multiplicative decrease) with fixed `Semaphore(128)` per peer, matching rqbit's
  simpler and faster approach. `pipeline.rs` gutted from 585→151 lines. EWMA
  throughput tracking and RTT measurement retained for snub detection and peer rate
  comparison.
- **Connection strategy simplified** — replaced three-phase `ConnectPhase`
  (RampUp 100ms → Normal 500ms → Steady 5s) with fixed 500ms connect interval
- **Snub → Disconnect** — snubbed peers (no data for `snub_timeout_secs`) are now
  fully disconnected instead of throttled to depth=1, freeing slots for healthy peers
- **`max_in_flight_pieces` raised** — default 256→512. Formula: `max(512, connected×4)`
  capped at `pieces/2`

### Removed
- AIMD congestion control logic (additive increase / multiplicative decrease)
- `ConnectPhase` enum and three-phase connection interval state machine
- ~430 lines of pipeline complexity

## [0.103.0] — 2026-03-16

### Added
- **BlockMaps** — pre-allocated atomic bit arrays for per-block request/received tracking,
  replacing coarse piece-level tracking with fine-grained block-level state
- **StealCandidates** — shared FIFO queue for pieces available for block stealing,
  populated when a piece has unrequested blocks remaining after initial assignment
- **3-phase dispatch** in `PeerDispatchState::next_block()`:
  Phase 1: hot sequential (continue current piece), Phase 2: CAS reserve (new piece),
  Phase 3: steal unrequested blocks from StealCandidates queue
- **Reactive snapshot** — 50ms dirty-flag debounce replaces 500ms fixed interval
  for availability snapshots, responding faster to have/bitfield changes
- **EndGame bypass** — when block stealing is enabled, EndGame mode is skipped
  (block stealing subsumes its purpose with less overhead)
- **`use_block_stealing` setting** — new session setting (default: `true`) to
  enable/disable per-block stealing dispatch
- 22 new tests covering BlockMaps, StealCandidates, and 3-phase dispatch

### Changed
- Deleted ~250 lines of legacy steal code from `piece_selector.rs`
- Removed 4 dead steal tests and 1 test from piece_selector cleanup (net +19 tests, 1555 total)

## [0.102.0] — 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Unified buffer pool** (`buffer_pool.rs`, ~1400 lines) — libtorrent 1.x-style cache
  replacing separate `ArcCache` read cache + `WriteBuffer` write buffer with a single
  `BufferPool`. One entry per piece transitions through Writing → Skeleton → Cached states.
- **Purpose-built byte-budget ARC** — adaptive replacement cache with T1/T2 deques,
  B1/B2 ghost lists, byte-level capacity tracking (not entry count), and `t2_keys()`
  query for BEP 6 suggest (proven-popular pieces accessed ≥2 times)
- **Hash-from-cache** — `hash_piece()` checks BufferPool for assembled blocks before
  reading from disk, eliminating the write→read→hash round-trip for every piece.
  Failed pieces never touch disk.
- **Full-piece prefetch** — read cache miss triggers full piece read from storage,
  subsequent block reads from same piece are cache hits (libtorrent 1.x model)
- **BEP 6 T2-based suggest** — `cached_pieces()` now returns T2 entries (capped at 16)
  instead of all cached pieces, maximising cache hit probability for suggested pieces
- **mlock support** — `libc::mlock()` on Cached entry memory at ARC insert, `munlock()`
  on eviction. Log-once suppression on RLIMIT_MEMLOCK failure.
- **Buffer pool settings** — `buffer_pool_capacity` (64 MiB default),
  `enable_mlock` (true on Unix), `max_suggest_pieces` default raised from 10 to 16
- 25 new tests (18 unit + 7 integration)

### Changed
- `DiskIoBackend::write_chunk()` now accepts `Bytes` instead of `&[u8]` (zero-copy
  from wire to cache)
- `DiskIoStats` extended with 5 new fields: `read_cache_bytes`, `pool_entries`,
  `prefetch_count`, `eviction_count`, `skeleton_count`
- `DiskStats` extended with matching fields (serde forward-compatible via `#[serde(default)]`)

### Removed
- `write_buffer.rs` (211 lines) — replaced by BufferPool
- `ArcCache` read cache in PosixDiskIo — replaced by BufferPool's purpose-built ARC

## [0.101.0] — 2026-03-16

### Added
- `Sha1Hasher` — incremental SHA-1 API in `torrent-core` for streaming verification
  (supports all three crypto backends: aws-lc, ring, openssl)
- `HashJob::Streaming` variant — hash pool workers call `backend.hash_piece()`
  directly instead of receiving pre-read piece data
- `smallvec` dependency in `torrent-storage` for stack-allocated file segments
- 8 new tests (SmallVec spill, batch writer drain/cap, Sha1Hasher, streaming verify)

### Changed
- **FileMap segments use SmallVec** — `byte_range_to_segments()`, `chunk_segments()`,
  `piece_segments()` return `SmallVec<[FileSegment; 4]>` instead of `Vec`, eliminating
  111K heap allocations per download (82% temporary)
- **Batch writer task** — writer drains up to 64 `WriteJob`s per `spawn_blocking` call,
  reducing thread pool submissions from ~93K to ~1.5K per download
- **Streaming piece verification** — `FilesystemStorage::verify_piece()` reads through
  a 64 KiB reusable buffer with incremental SHA-1, eliminating the 262 KiB per-piece
  allocation from the default `read_piece()` + `sha1()` path
- **Simplified `enqueue_verify`** — hash pool path submits `HashJob::Streaming` directly
  (no `spawn_blocking` + `read_piece` step); non-pool path calls `backend.hash_piece()`
  directly (~30 lines deleted)
- `HashJob` converted from struct to enum (`Data` / `Streaming`) with manual `Debug` impl

## [0.100.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- `DiskIoBackend::read_piece()` — read full piece from storage for disk-based verification
- Deferred write queue — per-torrent MPSC channel + dedicated writer task calls
  `spawn_blocking(storage.write_chunk())` for each block
- `DiskWriteState` — per-piece pending counter with `Notify` flush barrier
- `DiskHandle::write_block_deferred()` — enqueue block write, fallback to
  `block_in_place` if channel full
- `DiskHandle::flush_piece_writes()` — async barrier waits until all deferred
  writes for a piece complete
- 6 new tests for deferred write queue and disk-based verification

### Changed
- **Peer write path simplified** — replaced 80-line WriteCoalescer + store buffer
  block with single `disk.write_block_deferred()` call
- **Verification reads from disk** — `enqueue_verify`/`enqueue_verify_v2` now call
  `backend.read_piece()` instead of extracting from in-memory store buffer
- **TorrentActor flushes before verify** — `flush_piece_writes()` called before
  `enqueue_verify` at both piece-completion call sites
- RSS reduced to 46-73 MiB (from ~58 MiB with M99 pipeline)

### Removed
- `write_coalescer.rs` — per-peer block accumulator (~250 lines)
- `piece_buffer_pool.rs` — semaphore-gated buffer pool (~290 lines)
- `StoreBufferInner` — in-memory block store for verification (~70 lines)
- `DiskJob::WriteAsync` variant
- `store_buffer_max_bytes` and `piece_buffer_pool_size` settings
- ~1100 lines net deleted (1505 tests, was 1527)

## [0.99.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- `PieceBufferPool` — per-torrent pool of reusable `BytesMut` buffers gated by a
  tokio `Semaphore`, bounding the entire write pipeline to 32 concurrent pieces
- `piece_buffer_pool_size` setting (default: 32, `min_memory`: 8, `high_performance`: 64)
- `WriteCoalescer` pool integration — accepts pool buffers via `set_buffer()`,
  returns them on flush for recycling
- `DiskJob::WriteAsync` carries optional `OwnedSemaphorePermit` through pwrite()
- Peer task acquire/release lifecycle — buffer+permit acquired before new piece,
  buffer recycled on flush, permit held through disk write completion
- 10 new tests (1527 total)

### Changed
- Memory is now hard-bounded regardless of peer count: 16 MiB buffer pool +
  32 MiB store buffer ≈ 48 MiB total (previously unbounded coalescer buffers
  grew with peer count — 100 peers = 50+ MiB coalescer alone)
- Store buffer, verification paths, and hash pool are **unchanged** — this is
  the key safety property vs. the failed M99 v1 attempt

## [0.98.1] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- `buffer_reuse_across_pieces` test — asserts that `BytesMut` capacity is retained and data is independent after each flush

### Fixed
- **Write coalescer `flush_current()` buffer reuse** — replaced `split().freeze()` with `Bytes::copy_from_slice` + `clear()` to retain `BytesMut` capacity across pieces, eliminating ~3 GiB allocation churn on large torrents
- **Store buffer back-pressure** — `store_buffer_insert()` now returns an over-limit signal; peer task falls back to synchronous writes when the store buffer exceeds 32 MiB

1517 tests total.

## [0.98.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Write coalescing** (`WriteCoalescer`) — per-peer block accumulator that buffers incoming 16 KiB blocks and flushes entire pieces as single contiguous `pwrite()` calls, reducing disk write syscalls by ~32x (6,000/s → ~190/s at 100 MB/s)
- `FlushRequest` struct — returned by the coalescer when a piece is complete or when switching pieces, carries the coalesced `Bytes` payload
- `DiskHandle::store_buffer_insert()` — per-block store buffer population for hash verification, decoupled from disk writes
- `DiskHandle::enqueue_write_coalesced()` — non-blocking coalesced write that skips store buffer insertion (avoids double-insert since `store_buffer_insert` already populated it)
- 11 new tests: 7 WriteCoalescer unit tests (full piece, piece switch, boundary, disconnect flush, last piece, out-of-order assert, empty flush), 3 DiskHandle tests (insert populates, coalesced skips buffer, back-pressure), 1 integration test (end-to-end peer data path)

### Changed
- `Message::Piece` handler in peer task now uses a dual write path: coalesced path (when `WriteCoalescer` is initialized after `StartRequesting`) with per-block `store_buffer_insert` + coalesced flush, or fallback per-block `enqueue_write` (pre-`StartRequesting` edge case)
- Disconnect cleanup flushes any partial coalesced data with proper back-pressure fallback to synchronous `write_chunk`
- `FLUSH_PIECE` flag applied to all coalesced writes for immediate disk persistence

## [0.97.1] — 2026-03-15

### Changed
- **DHT bootstrap simplification** — removed the M97 `PingVerify` verification system (~120 lines) which was over-engineered and caused 80% cold-start failure with stale saved state
- `bootstrap()` now partitions saved nodes vs DNS hostnames: saved nodes receive `ping` (validates liveness via normal response handler), DNS nodes receive `find_node` (fresh neighbour discovery). This prevents stale neighbourhood data from flooding the routing table.
- Added Transmission-style node-count gate: routing table ≥8 nodes opens the bootstrap gate early without waiting for `FindNodeLookup` convergence. Gate is checked both in `start_get_peers()` and on every ping tick (5s).
- `PING_INTERVAL` reduced from 225s to 5s — aggressive stale node eviction (questionable nodes detected in ~10s), aligned with libtorrent's maintenance model
- Benchmark results: 10/10 clean state, 10/10 saved state (was 2/10 saved state before fix)

### Removed
- `PingVerify` variant from `PendingQueryKind`
- `send_ping_verify()`, `check_saved_node_verification()` methods
- `saved_node_pings_outstanding`, `saved_node_ping_responses`, `saved_node_verified` fields
- Verification phase in `bootstrap()` and timeout tracking in `expire_queries_and_advance_lookups()`

## [0.97.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Bootstrap completion gate** — `get_peers` lookups are queued until `FindNodeLookup` completes, preventing peer discovery on a half-populated routing table
- `on_bootstrap_complete()` drains the queued `get_peers` requests once bootstrap finishes
- 10-second bootstrap timeout safety net to unblock the gate if bootstrap stalls indefinitely
- **Saved-node verification** — on startup, a sample of persisted DHT nodes are pinged; if fewer than 4 respond, all routing table nodes are marked `Questionable` and a fresh bootstrap from hardcoded nodes is triggered
- `PingVerify` query variant for distinguishing verification pings from ordinary maintenance pings
- `mark_all_questionable()` method on `RoutingTable` for saved-node fallback
- **V6 exponential backoff** — replaces the fixed 100 ms IPv6 retry interval with exponential backoff (100 ms → 5 s), reducing ~30 lookups/3 s to ~8 lookups/12 s during V6 failures
- `should_retry_v6()` / `v6_retry_delay()` helpers encapsulating the backoff logic

### Changed
- Cold-start reliability improved from ~95% to ~99%+; eliminates 270-second stalls caused by premature `get_peers` on empty routing tables

## [0.96.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- `HashPool` — dedicated thread pool for CPU-bound SHA1 piece hash verification
- Per-torrent result channels with generation counter for stale hash detection
- `handle_hash_result()` method in TorrentActor with staleness + domination guards
- New `select!` arm for parallel hash results
- `WorkerMsg::Shutdown` sentinel for deadlock-free `Drop`
- `set_hash_pool()` and `set_hash_result_tx()` setters on `DiskHandle`

### Changed
- `enqueue_verify()` gains `generation` parameter and dual-path dispatch (HashPool for v1, spawn_blocking for hybrid/v2)
- `piece_generations: Vec<u64>` tracks re-reservation to prevent stale results
- Session startup creates shared `Arc<HashPool>` from `hashing_threads` setting

## [0.95.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- Pin tokio worker threads to CPU cores via `core_affinity::set_for_current()` in `on_thread_start` hook for improved L1/L2 cache locality
- `runtime_worker_threads` and `pin_cores` settings in `Settings` (JSON-configurable)
- `--workers` and `--no-pin-cores` CLI flags for runtime tuning
- `build_runtime()` function with round-robin core pinning via `AtomicUsize`

### Changed
- Replaced `#[tokio::main]` with manual `fn main()` for runtime control
- Config loading moved from `download::run()` to `main()` (DRY fix — load once, pass through `DownloadOpts`)
- Worker thread count auto-capped at `min(available_cores, 8)`

## [0.94.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Memory footprint reduction (M94)**: Bounded `StoreBuffer` with byte tracking — accumulates
  in-flight write bytes and applies back-pressure when the 32 MiB default limit is exceeded,
  preventing unbounded memory growth during disk saturation.
- `store_buffer_bytes` field added to `DiskStats` for real-time monitoring of write-buffer
  memory consumption.
- Codec read buffer shrinking on idle: peer codec reclaims its 16 KiB+ read buffer when the
  peer is choked, cursor is exhausted, or the connection disconnects — reduces per-idle-peer
  RSS proportionally to swarm size.

### Changed
- Default disk cache reduced from 64 MiB to 16 MiB (8 MiB write + 8 MiB read), with the
  write ratio raised from 0.25 to 0.5. Keeps the cache effective for typical workloads while
  significantly reducing baseline RSS.

### Fixed
- Fixed byte-count leak in `StoreBuffer` on duplicate block insertion — duplicate blocks now
  correctly skip the byte accounting increment, preventing the tracked size from drifting above
  actual buffer occupancy.

## [0.93.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Lock-free piece dispatch (M93)**: Replaced `Arc<parking_lot::RwLock<PieceReservationState>>`
  with atomic CAS-based dispatch. Peer tasks CAS-reserve pieces directly via `AtomicPieceStates`
  (`Vec<AtomicU8>`) — zero locks on the hot path. The hot path for subsequent blocks of the
  same already-reserved piece involves zero atomic operations.
- `PieceState` — `repr(u8)` enum encoding the three dispatch states (Free/Reserved/Complete)
  for use in `AtomicU8` CAS operations.
- `AtomicPieceStates` — `Vec<AtomicU8>` wrapper providing CAS-based piece reservation with
  `try_reserve()`, `release()`, and `mark_complete()` operations.
- `AvailabilitySnapshot` — O(n) bucket-sorted rarest-first ordering rebuilt every 500ms by the
  actor and broadcast to all peer tasks via `PeerCommand::SnapshotUpdate`.
- `PeerDispatchState` — per-peer cursor into the snapshot with hot/cold path distinction:
  hot path (next block of owned piece) skips all atomics; cold path CAS-races against peers.
- `PeerSlab` — arena-allocated peer index (`slab` crate) for O(1) insert/remove of peer state
  without hash-map overhead.
- `PeerCommand::SnapshotUpdate` — carries updated `AvailabilitySnapshot` to peer tasks on
  the 500ms rebuild timer.
- `PeerEvent::PieceReleased` — sent when a peer disconnects mid-piece, allowing the actor to
  free the reservation for other peers.
- 25 new unit tests covering CAS reservation races, snapshot rebuild, hot/cold path dispatch,
  and release-on-disconnect.

### Changed
- Actor now manages `availability` and `piece_owner` as plain `Vec` fields (single-threaded
  actor context), eliminating all lock overhead from the actor side.
- Added `slab` crate dependency to `torrent-session` for arena-allocated peer tracking.

### Removed
- `PieceReservationState` struct — replaced by `AtomicPieceStates` + actor-owned plain fields.
- `PeerProgress` struct — per-peer progress tracking subsumed into `PeerDispatchState`.
- `parking_lot` dependency removed from `torrent-session` (lock-free dispatch eliminated the
  last `RwLock` use in that crate).
- 28 unit tests made redundant by the new atomic dispatch model.

## [0.92.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Peer event batching (M92)**: Replaced per-block `PeerEvent::ChunkWritten` channel sends
  with batched `PieceBlocksBatch` to reduce context switches. Each peer task accumulates
  block completions in a `PendingBatch` struct, flushing immediately on piece completion
  or every 25ms via a timer. Targets ~3x context switch reduction (462K → ~150K).
- `BlockEntry` struct — lightweight record of block write completions for batch transport.
- `PendingBatch` struct — per-peer block accumulator with piece-completion detection via
  `Lengths::chunks_in_piece()`, 25ms flush timer arm in the `tokio::select!` loop, and
  flush-on-disconnect to prevent block loss.
- 8 unit tests for `PendingBatch` covering full-piece completion, timer flush, last-piece
  edge case, multi-piece interleaving, cross-piece boundary reset, and disconnect flush.

### Changed
- Extracted `process_block_completion()` from `handle_chunk_written()` — identical logic,
  now returns `bool` for piece completion signalling in batch iteration.
- `PeerCommand::StartRequesting` now carries `Lengths` for `PendingBatch` construction.
- Removed dead `handle_chunk_written()` method (replaced by `process_block_completion()`).

## [0.91.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **SimTransport integration tests (M91)**: 4 end-to-end transfer tests validating
  actual data flow through the simulated network — basic seeder-to-leecher (64 KiB),
  multi-peer swarm (4 nodes, 128 KiB), network partition recovery with heal/re-introduce,
  and link config transfer (latency/bandwidth config set without crash).

### Changed
- **Removed stale `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations** from `SimConnection`, `NetworkInner`,
  `register_listener()`, and `connect_tcp()` in `torrent-sim` — now exercised by transfer tests.
  Retained annotations on `unregister_listener()` (test-only) and `factories` field (Arc lifetime).

## [0.90.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **I2P session integration (M90)**: Outbound I2P peer connects routed through SAM
  session with timeout and transport identification. I2P destination tracking via
  synthetic 240.0.0.0/4 address mapping. HTTP tracker announces include I2P
  destination per BEP 7. Mixed-mode PEX filtering prevents I2P/clearnet address
  leakage. Ignored integration test for environments with SAM bridge.

## [0.88.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **BEP 44 session API**: `SessionHandle` now exposes `dht_put_immutable()`,
  `dht_get_immutable()`, `dht_put_mutable()`, and `dht_get_mutable()` for DHT
  storage operations. Handlers forward to `DhtHandle` and fire pre-defined alerts
  (`DhtPutComplete`, `DhtGetResult`, `DhtMutablePutComplete`, `DhtMutableGetResult`,
  `DhtItemError`). Returns `Error::DhtDisabled` when DHT is off.

## [0.87.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- **BEP 52 hash serving**: v2/hybrid seeders now serve piece-layer Merkle hashes to
  peers via `HashRequest` (message ID 21) instead of always rejecting. Extracts
  `serve_hashes()` as a standalone testable function. Uses `MerkleTree::proof_path()`
  for uncle proofs with correct subtree proof layout. V1-only torrents and invalid
  requests are still rejected.

### Changed
- Removed unused placeholder fields from `PieceHashRequest` (`_num_requests`) and
  `BlockHashRequest` (`_last_request`, `_num_requests`) in hash_picker.rs.
- Fixed 6 redundant closures (`|i| leaf(i)` → `leaf`) in merkle.rs tests.

## [0.85.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Iterative bootstrap**: DHT now performs multi-round `find_node` queries during
  bootstrap, converging on the closest nodes to our own ID. Previously, bootstrap
  sent one-shot queries to 3 DNS-resolved nodes with no follow-up — now it iterates
  through returned nodes (alpha=3, up to 6 rounds) to rapidly populate the routing table.
- **Node liveness tracking**: `NodeStatus` enum (Good/Questionable/Bad) per BEP 5 §4.1.
  Nodes that respond or query us within 15 minutes are Good; silent nodes are Questionable;
  nodes with 2+ consecutive failures are Bad and eligible for eviction.
- **Background pinger**: Questionable nodes are pinged every 3.75 minutes. Nodes that
  respond become Good again; those that don't accumulate failures and get evicted.
- **Query rate limiter**: Token-bucket rate limiter (250 queries/sec default) guards all
  outgoing KRPC queries, preventing UDP flood during rapid bootstrap or large lookups.
- **Periodic DHT persistence**: Session state (DHT nodes) saved every 60 seconds with
  atomic write-then-rename, not just on shutdown. Crash recovery now preserves recent state.
- **Proper failure tracking**: `PendingQuery` now stores the remote node's ID, so timed-out
  queries correctly increment `fail_count` on the actual node (previously used a stub that
  never marked any node as failed).

### Changed
- Default `queries_per_second` increased from 50 to 250 (both IPv4 and IPv6 configs).
- `worst_node()` eviction now correctly evicts the oldest node on tied fail counts
  (was incorrectly evicting the newest).
- `PendingQueryKind::FindNode` and `SampleInfohashes` simplified to unit variants (dead
  `target` fields removed — the target is in the KRPC message, not needed in pending state).
- `ItemLookupState`: removed dead `closest` fields (never iterated for advancement) and
  `public_key` from `Mutable` variant (comes from the response, not lookup state).
- Zero `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations remain in the DHT actor.

### Fixed
- Dead nodes no longer occupy routing table slots forever — the `pending_node_id()` stub
  that returned `Id20::ZERO` (never matching any node) has been replaced with actual node
  ID tracking in `PendingQuery`.
- **DHT node ID persistence**: BEP 42-compliant node ID now saved in session state and
  restored on startup. Previously, every session generated a random ID that BEP 42
  immediately replaced, causing ~50% of saved routing table nodes to be lost on reload.
  Routing table now accumulates across sessions (17 → 100+ nodes after 2 runs).
- **Re-bootstrap after BEP 42 regeneration**: When BEP 42 prunes the routing table after
  node ID regeneration, a fresh iterative bootstrap now runs targeting the new ID. Without
  this, the table stayed pruned at ~16 nodes.
- **V6 DHT give-up**: Stop retrying V6 DHT get_peers after 30 consecutive empty-table
  rejections (~3 seconds). Previously retried every 100ms forever, producing ~100 lines
  of log spam per session when the V6 bootstrap node was unreachable.
- **M86**: Removed dead `DiskIoBackend::move_storage()` trait method and all plumbing
  (3 stub impls, `DiskJob::MoveStorage`, `DiskHandle::move_storage()`). The actual move
  operation is handled by `TorrentActor::handle_move_storage()` via `relocate_files()`.
- **M89**: NAT port mapping cleanup (`do_unmap()`) now logs deletion failures at debug
  level instead of silently discarding them with `let _ =`.

## [0.84.0] — 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **Default crypto backend**: Switched from `ring` (BoringSSL) to `aws-lc-rs` (AWS-LC).
  AWS-LC's SHA-1/SHA-256 implementation is significantly faster on modern x86_64 with
  SHA-NI/AVX-512. Benchmarked: 28% less user CPU, 23% less RSS, 25% fewer page faults.
  The `ring` and `openssl` backends remain available via feature flags (`crypto-ring`,
  `crypto-openssl`).

### Added
- **Pluggable crypto backends**: New feature flags `crypto-ring`, `crypto-aws-lc` (default),
  and `crypto-openssl` on `torrent-core`, forwarded through `torrent` facade and `torrent-cli`.
  Allows compile-time selection of the SHA hashing backend. When multiple backends are enabled
  via feature unification, priority is: openssl > aws-lc > ring.
- **Crypto benchmark script**: `benchmarks/bench_crypto.sh` for A/B testing crypto backends
  with full metrics (CPU, RSS, context switches, page faults).

### Benchmark (Arch ISO ~1.45 GiB, 3 trials, ring vs aws-lc)
- User CPU: 7.30s avg (-28% from ring's 10.13s)
- RSS: 107 MB avg (-23% from ring's 139 MB)
- Speed: 55.7 MB/s avg (+13% over ring's 49.1 MB/s)
- Page faults: 55K avg (-25% from ring's 73K)
- Test count: 1442

## [0.83.0] — 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **Default encryption mode**: Changed from `PreferPlaintext` to `Disabled`. Eliminates
  23.4% CPU overhead (RC4 21.5% + DH key exchange 1.9%) and removes 3 extra RTT MSE
  handshake per connection. rqbit does not implement MSE at all — this matches its
  behaviour. Users needing encryption can opt in via settings.

### Fixed
- **AIMD initial queue depth mismatch**: Peer task's `INITIAL_QUEUE_DEPTH` was hardcoded
  to 32 while the settings default was 128. This forced 3 seconds of unnecessary AIMD
  slow-start ramp (32→64→128) on every peer connection. Now starts at 128 immediately.
- **CLI SIGTERM handling**: CLI only handled SIGINT (Ctrl+C) via `tokio::signal::ctrl_c()`.
  Benchmarks using `timeout --signal=TERM` and systemd stops bypassed the shutdown flag
  entirely — `save_session_state()` never ran, DHT nodes were lost. Now handles both
  SIGINT and SIGTERM via `tokio::select!`, enabling DHT node persistence across all
  termination scenarios.

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 2026.03.01 ~1.45 GiB, 3 trials)
- Speed: 56.8 MB/s avg (+47% over v0.82.0's 38.6 MB/s), peak 83.5 MB/s
- CPU: 13.1s avg (-29% from v0.82.0's 18.4s — crypto overhead eliminated)
- RSS: 68.8 MiB avg (-27% from v0.82.0's 94 MiB — no RC4 cipher buffers)
- Gap to rqbit narrowed from 1.9x to 1.3x (74.8 MB/s)
- Test count: 1442

## [0.82.0] — 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **Adaptive max_in_flight**: `max_in_flight` now scales dynamically with peer count
  (`max(256, peers × 3)` capped at `num_pieces / 2`). More connected peers automatically
  unlock more parallelism instead of being bottlenecked by a fixed 256 limit.
- **Cached rarest-first dispatch**: Pre-sorted candidate cache eliminates O(n) full-piece
  scans in `find_candidate()` and `next_request()`. Cache is invalidated on availability
  changes and rebuilt lazily on WRITE-lock paths. READ-lock path uses stale cache with
  `can_reserve()` guard for safe filtering.
- **AIMD pipeline**: Replaced fixed queue depth (128) with AIMD (Additive Increase,
  Multiplicative Decrease) congestion control. Slow-start doubles depth each second when
  throughput increases; steady-state adds +4 blocks/s. After 3 consecutive throughput
  decreases, depth halves. 4-tick cooldown prevents oscillation. Initial depth starts at
  32 and ramps up per-peer based on actual throughput.
- **Permit absorption for depth reduction**: When AIMD decreases target depth, excess
  semaphore permits are absorbed by not returning them on block receive, plus active
  draining of idle permits on the tick path. Unchoke handler drains stale permits before
  refilling to prevent phantom permit accumulation after Choke/Unchoke cycles.

### Fixed
- **Semaphore drain infinite loop**: The Unchoke handler's `while try_acquire().is_ok()`
  loop was an infinite loop — `SemaphorePermit`'s RAII `Drop` released the permit back
  immediately, so the count never reached zero. Same issue in pipeline tick depth-reduction
  drain. Fixed with `permit.forget()` to permanently consume permits.

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 2026.03.01 ~1.45 GiB, 3 trials)
- Speed: 38.6 MB/s avg (+31% over v0.78.0's 29.5 MB/s), peak 62.1 MB/s
- RSS: 88.9 MiB avg (-28% from v0.78.0's 123 MiB)
- Faster than qbittorrent (32.0 MB/s), gap to rqbit (77.0 MB/s) narrowed
- Test count: 1442 (+15 new tests)

## [0.81.0] — 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **Three-phase connect interval**: Replaced the binary `burst_connect` flag with a
  `ConnectPhase` enum implementing three connection phases: RampUp (0–15s, 100ms interval),
  Normal (15–60s, 500ms interval), and Steady (60s+, 5s interval). The old code used a
  single transition from 500ms to 5s at 10s. The new three-phase approach gives 5× faster
  initial peer discovery (100ms vs 500ms) over a longer ramp-up window (15s vs 10s),
  with a gradual settling period before reaching the steady-state 5s interval.

## [0.78.0] — 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **`notify_one()` replaces `notify_waiters()` in piece completion**: `complete_piece()` and
  `fail_piece()` in `piece_reservation.rs` now call `notify_one()` instead of `notify_waiters()`.
  Each completion frees exactly one slot — waking all 127 waiting peers simultaneously was
  wasteful. The safety-net periodic tick (added in M77) catches any missed wakeups.
- **Two-phase dispatch for `next_request()`**: Split the monolithic single-WRITE-lock O(n) scan
  into three phases: `try_current_piece()` (WRITE lock, O(1) hot path, ~15/16 calls),
  `find_candidate()` (READ lock, O(n) scan — runs concurrently across all peers), and
  `try_reserve()` (WRITE lock, O(1) race-guarded reservation). Allows 127 peers to scan the
  piece list simultaneously instead of serializing behind one writer.
- **Direct peer-to-disk writes**: Peer tasks now write block data directly to disk via
  `DiskHandle::enqueue_write()` instead of routing the full data payload through the actor's
  event channel. The actor receives lightweight `ChunkWritten` events (metadata only: piece
  index, begin offset, length) for bookkeeping. Removes ~1.45 GB of data transit through the
  event channel per download.

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 2026.03.01 ~1.45 GiB)
- Speed: 46.8 MB/s avg (3 trials) — flat vs M77's 48.2 MB/s (~3% delta, within swarm noise)
- RSS: 81.2 MB avg (down from M77's 89.4 MB, -9%)
- Test count: 1427 (+8 new dispatch tests)

## [0.77.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Safety-net periodic notification**: Added a 1-second `notify_waiters()` call in the
  `pipeline_tick` arm of `TorrentActor`'s select loop. Ensures request waiters are never
  permanently starved if a high-frequency notify path is removed or silent.

### Changed
- **Remove `notify_waiters()` from `add_peer()` and `peer_have()`**: These high-frequency
  methods in `piece_reservation.rs` were triggering wake storms — up to 128 context switches
  per call as all waiting peers woke simultaneously. Notifications are now consolidated into
  the periodic safety-net tick.
- **Increase event batch drain limit 256 → 512**: The event processing loop now drains up to
  512 events per iteration, reducing the frequency at which the actor yields back to the
  executor under high event throughput.
- **`pipeline_tick` uses `MissedTickBehavior::Skip`**: Prevents burst wake storms when the
  actor falls behind; missed ticks are discarded instead of firing in rapid succession.

### Benchmark (Arch ISO ~1.5 GiB, 3 trials)
- Speed: 54.2 MB/s avg (+3.2% over M76's 52.5 MB/s)
- RSS: 88 MB avg
- Test count: 1419

## [0.76.0] — 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **Remove `PieceSelector` from production code**: Gated `PieceSelector` (2,271 lines) and 5
  related types (`PeerSpeed`, `PeerSpeedClassifier`, `InFlightPiece`, `PickContext`, `PickResult`)
  behind `#[cfg(test)]`. Availability reads now go through `PieceReservationState::availability()`.
- **Remove `in_flight_pieces` dead code**: Eliminated the never-populated
  `FxHashMap<u32, InFlightPiece>` field and all 21 reference sites from `TorrentActor`. Diagnostic
  and web-seed queries now use `PieceReservationState` methods (`in_flight_count()`,
  `in_flight_peers()`, `is_piece_in_flight()`).
- **Move `peer_bitfields` to peer-local state**: Removed duplicate `FxHashMap<SocketAddr, Bitfield>`
  from `PieceReservationState`. Bitfield data is now passed as parameters to `remove_peer()`,
  `peer_have()`, and `next_request()`. Each peer task maintains its own `local_bitfield` for
  dispatch decisions. Have message dedup moved from shared state to actor level.
- **Burst-mode connection interval**: Start with 500ms connect interval for the first 10 seconds,
  then transition to 5s steady-state. Reduces startup/ramp-up overhead.
- **Fix `evaluate_auto_sequential`**: Now uses `reservation_state.in_flight_count()` instead of
  the always-zero `in_flight_pieces.len()`, allowing auto-sequential mode to actually activate.

### Benchmark (Arch ISO ~1.5 GiB, 3 trials)
- Speed: 52.5 MB/s median (no regression from M75's 56.7)
- RSS: 81 MB median (down from M75's 98 MB, -17%)
- Cache misses: 7.4M median (down from M75's 9.1M, -19%)
- Test count: 1419

## [0.75.0] — 2026-03-12

### Changed
- **Peer-integrated request dispatch**: Moved block requesting from separate `request_driver`
  tasks into each peer task's `tokio::select!` loop. Semaphore permits are now acquired and
  returned within the same task, eliminating the cross-task handoff that caused permit leaks
  in M73/M74. Architecture matches rqbit's proven single-task model.
- **Local per-peer semaphore**: Each peer task owns a `Semaphore::new(0)` that receives 128
  permits on unchoke (capped by `available_permits()`) and returns permits on Piece/RejectRequest
  receipt. No more global permit coordination.
- **End-game activation from reservation state**: `check_end_game_activation()` now uses
  `PieceReservationState::in_flight_count()` and `in_flight_peers()` to build the end-game
  block map, since the actor-side `in_flight_pieces` HashMap is no longer populated.

### Removed
- **`request_driver` module**: Deleted entirely (155 lines). Per-peer driver tasks, driver
  spawn/cancel/respawn logic, and 6+ actor-side permit return sites all eliminated.
- **`PeerState` driver fields**: Removed `semaphore`, `driver_cancel`, `driver_handle` from
  actor-side peer tracking.

### Benchmark (Arch ISO ~1.5 GiB, 3 trials)
- Speed: 56.7±11.7 MB/s (4.6x improvement over M74's 12.2 MB/s)
- CPU: 36–44% (down from M74's higher utilization)
- RSS: 86–116 MiB, stable across trials (M74 showed 69→125 MiB growth)
- rqbit reference: 82 MB/s (now at 69% of rqbit, was 15% in M74)
- Test count: 1419

## [0.74.0] — 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Semaphore permit leak on `try_send` failure**: Request driver replaced `try_send()`
  with cancellation-aware `send().await` via `tokio::select!`. A full channel no longer
  exits the driver (losing the permit forever); instead backpressure is applied naturally.
  Permits are explicitly returned on both cancellation and channel close.
- **Permit leak on rejected requests**: `RejectRequest` events from peers now return the
  semaphore permit that the driver consumed when sending the request. Without this, each
  rejection permanently reduces the driver's dispatch capacity.
- **Permit leak on write failures**: Early returns from `handle_piece_data()` on disk
  write errors now return the permit before bailing out.
- **Stale driver on MSE retry**: When a peer retries with plaintext after MSE failure,
  the old request driver (holding a stale `cmd_tx`) is now cancelled and cleaned up.
  Previously the stale driver would send requests into a dead channel, leaking permits
  and causing piece deadlocks.
- **MSE retry channel capacity**: Increased from 64 → 256 to match the higher throughput
  of per-peer autonomous dispatch.

### Benchmark (Arch ISO ~1.4 GiB, 3 trials)
- Speed: 12.2±5.6 MB/s (improved from M73's 10.8±6.2, still regressed from M72's 28.0)
- CPU: 25.3±6.0s (up from M73's 19.3s — high variance suggests resource accumulation)
- RSS: 87.5±30.2 MiB (up from M73's 67.6 MiB — trial 3 hit 125 MiB)
- rqbit reference: 82.2 MB/s, 9.8s CPU, 39.4 MiB RSS (6.7x speed gap)
- Test count: 1419

## [0.73.0] — 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Piece reservation state** (`PieceReservationState`): Shared state behind
  `Arc<parking_lot::RwLock<_>>` for concurrent per-peer dispatch. Piece-level
  exclusive ownership prevents the duplicate block assignment that caused M62's
  data corruption. Simplified picker: priority pieces → rarest-first.
- **Per-peer request drivers** (`request_driver`): Autonomous tokio tasks per
  unchoked peer. Each driver acquires semaphore permits (flow control), reserves
  pieces from shared state, and sends `PeerCommand::Request` directly to the
  peer task — bypassing the TorrentActor entirely for normal dispatch.
- `parking_lot` workspace dependency (fast synchronous RwLock for ~10μs
  critical sections).

### Changed
- **Architecture: actor-serialized → per-peer autonomous dispatch.** The
  TorrentActor no longer runs `batch_fill_all_peers()` or
  `request_pieces_from_peer()` for normal downloads. Drivers handle all dispatch
  reactively. The actor handles only verification, peer lifecycle, and endgame.
- `max_in_flight_pieces`: 40 → 256 (accommodates per-peer piece reservation)
- `min_memory` preset: 16 → 32 | `high_performance` preset: 80 → 512
- Pipeline tick: 500ms → 1000ms (dispatch is fully reactive via drivers)

### Removed
- `batch_fill_all_peers()` (~335 lines) — replaced by per-peer drivers
- `request_pieces_from_peer()` (~230 lines) — replaced by per-peer drivers
- `PeerCommand::RequestBatch` — drivers send individual `Request` per block
- `PeerState::block_queue` / `needs_refill` — replaced by semaphore flow control
- `refill_notify` select arm — drivers wake via `piece_notify`

### Benchmark (Arch ISO ~1.4 GiB, 3 trials)
- Speed: 10.8±6.2 MB/s (regression from 28.0 MB/s — dispatch stalls under investigation)
- CPU: 19.3±2.9s (down from 31.9s — 40% reduction)
- RSS: 67.6±4.6 MiB (down from 94.8 MiB — 29% reduction)
- Test count: 1419

## [0.72.0] — 2026-03-11

### Changed
- **Zero-alloc steal phase**: Rewrote `pick_partial` steal phase to iterate `assigned_blocks`
  directly instead of calling `missing_chunks_into()` → `Vec::extend` → `Vec::retain`. Reduces
  steal scan from O(total_chunks) to O(assigned_blocks) per in-flight piece, eliminating all
  `chunk_info()` calls, Vec allocations, and HashMap probes from the steal path.
- **Steal early-out**: Skip the O(pieces × blocks) steal scan entirely when no peer has a rate
  below the steal threshold. O(peers) check via `peer_rates.values().any()`.
- Test count: 1409

## [0.71.0] — 2026-03-11

### Added
- **ChunkMask 256-bit bitfield**: Fixed-size `[u64; 4]` bitfield tracking unassigned chunks per
  `InFlightPiece`. Maintained incrementally (clear on assign, set on disconnect/freed). Replaces
  the re-compute-and-filter pattern with O(1) bit operations.

### Changed
- **Zero-alloc block selection**: `unassigned_blocks()` now reads `ChunkMask::iter_set_bits()`
  directly instead of calling `missing_chunks_into()` → `Vec::extend` → `Vec::retain`. Eliminates
  the top 3 CPU hotspots (24.27% `Vec::retain`, 8.40% `Vec::extend`, 7.24% `missing_chunks_into`).
- **Two-phase `pick_partial` scoring**: Phase 1 scores all in-flight pieces via `count_ones()`/
  `is_empty()` (zero allocation). Phase 2 enumerates blocks only for the winning piece.
- **Inlined hot-path cross-crate functions**: `#[inline]` on `Lengths::piece_size()`,
  `chunks_in_piece()`, `chunk_info()` and `Bitfield::get()` — enables cross-crate inlining
  without LTO for functions called ~300K times per batch fill cycle.
- CPU time reduced 23% (37.1s → 28.7s on Arch ISO benchmark)
- Test count: 1405

## [0.70.0] — 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **Pre-computed per-peer block queues**: Each peer gets a `VecDeque` of pre-assigned blocks filled
  during batch passes. `handle_piece_data()` dispatch is now O(1) — pop from queue instead of running
  the 5-layer picker on every block arrival (~91K invocations eliminated per 1.4 GiB download).
- **Shared-context batch fill**: Pipeline tick clones `we_have` bitfield ONCE for all peers instead of
  per-peer, with shared scratch buffer. Eliminates O(peers) redundant allocations per tick.
- **RequestBatch channel optimization**: Batch block requests into a single `PeerCommand::RequestBatch`
  channel message, reducing mpsc channel sends from N-per-peer to 1-per-peer per refill.
- **Reactive dispatch via `tokio::sync::Notify`**: Actor wakes immediately when any peer's queue drops
  below threshold, reducing worst-case dispatch latency from 250ms to ~1ms. Notify coalesces multiple
  signals for efficient batch refill.
- **Stale block cleanup**: Verified/failed pieces are swept from all peers' block_queues. End-game
  activation drains all queues to prevent orphaned assignments.
- **`max_in_flight_pieces` 20 → 40**: More concurrent pieces for better parallelism across peers.
  Presets: `min_memory()` = 16, `high_performance()` = 80.
- **Pipeline tick 250ms → 500ms**: Safety net only — Notify handles the fast path.
- Test count: 1392

## [0.68.0] — 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **Pipeline dispatch latency reduced**: Lowered `BATCH_DISPATCH_THRESHOLD` from 32 to 4 and pipeline tick
  interval from 1s to 250ms — worst-case dispatch latency drops from 1000ms to 250ms while picker CPU
  remains under 1%.
- **Fixed-depth pipeline model**: Replaced BDP-based adaptive queue depth with fixed depth at
  `initial_queue_depth` (128). Eliminates the negative feedback loop where low throughput → low depth →
  lower throughput. EWMA rate tracking retained for stats only.
- **Event channel throughput**: Increased event channel capacity 256 → 2048 and batch-drain limit
  64 → 256. Added `biased;` to `tokio::select!` with data-processing arms first, ensuring peer events
  take priority over timer maintenance.
- **PreferPlaintext encryption mode**: New default encryption mode offers plaintext-only MSE on outbound
  connections, falling back to plaintext + RC4 if the peer rejects. Reduces RC4 CPU overhead (31.6% of
  profile) for peers that accept plaintext. `Enabled` and `Forced` modes preserved for compatibility.
- **Scratch buffer API**: Refactored piece selector closure from `Fn(u32) -> Vec<(u32, u32)>` to
  `Fn(u32, &mut Vec<(u32, u32)>)`, threading a reusable scratch buffer through all 10 picker functions.
  Eliminates ~800K temporary `Vec` allocations per download.
- **Stack-array `peer_count()`**: Replaced `HashSet<&SocketAddr>` allocation with fixed-size `[SocketAddr; 8]`
  stack array for counting unique peers per in-flight piece. Falls back to `HashSet` only when >8 unique peers.
- **`max_in_flight_pieces` 32 → 20**: Reduced default from 32 to 20, cutting store buffer memory from 16 MiB
  to 10 MiB. Presets: `min_memory()` = 12, `high_performance()` = 64.
- Test count: 1392

## [0.67.0] — 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **BoringSSL crypto via `ring`**: Replaced `sha1`/`sha2` crates with `ring` (BoringSSL hand-optimized
  AVX2 assembly). ~4.6x SHA1 throughput improvement on Broadwell (174 → ~800 MB/s). All four hash
  functions (`sha1`, `sha1_chunks`, `sha256`, `sha256_chunks`) and MSE handshake hashing now use `ring::digest`.
- **`target-cpu=native` codegen**: Added `.cargo/config.toml` enabling AVX2/SHA-NI/BMI2 instruction
  generation for all crates (binaries are build-machine specific).
- **RC4 write buffer reuse**: `MseStream::poll_write` now reuses a persistent `Vec<u8>` instead of
  allocating per write — zero allocations after the first encrypted write.
- **Default peers reduced 200 → 128**: Default `max_peers_per_torrent` lowered from 200 to 128;
  `high_performance` preset from 500 to 250. Reduces per-piece verification overhead.
- Removed all direct `sha1`/`sha2` crate dependencies from workspace.
- Test count: 1395

## [0.66.0] — 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **Adaptive queue depth (BDP model)**: Per-peer request pipeline depth now computed dynamically
  using libtorrent's Bandwidth-Delay Product formula: `depth = (ewma_rate × request_queue_time / 16384)`
  clamped to `[16, max_queue_depth]`. Fast peers get deeper pipelines (up to 250 slots), slow peers
  get shallower ones (floor of 16). Replaces fixed 128-slot depth for all peers.
- Snub override flag (`depth_overridden`) prevents BDP formula from overwriting snub depth of 1;
  cleared on un-snub via `reset_to_slow_start()`
- `request_queue_time` parameter (previously ignored with `_` prefix) now actively used in BDP computation
- Test count: 1395

## [0.65.0] — 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **SHA hardware acceleration**: Enabled `asm` feature on `sha1`/`sha2` crates for runtime CPU-dispatched
  SHA-NI instructions — accelerates piece verification and MSE/PE encryption handshakes
- **Batch dispatch threshold**: Gated per-block picker invocation behind a 32-slot free threshold,
  reducing ~91k picker calls to ~2.9k per 1.4 GiB download (~97% reduction in hot-path CPU)
- Pipeline tick safety net widened to catch both fully idle peers and peers crossing the batch threshold

## [0.61.0] — M61 Performance Optimizations

### Performance
- **O(1) pending request lookup** — replaced `PeerState.pending_requests: Vec<(u32, u32, u32)>` with `PendingRequests` newtype wrapping `FxHashMap<(u32, u32), u32>`. Eliminates O(128) linear scan on every block received (~6000/sec). 4 call sites converted from `.iter().position()` + `.swap_remove()` to `.remove(index, begin)`.
- **End-game cascade eliminated** — removed reactive re-requesting loop that triggered 50 picker invocations per block in end-game mode. Replaced with a 200ms periodic batch refill tick (`end_game_tick_interval`) with `MissedTickBehavior::Skip` to prevent burst-fire on activation. All peers with available pipeline slots refilled in a single pass.
- **END_GAME_DEPTH raised 4 → 128** — matches normal-mode pipeline depth. With depth 4, each peer only had 64KB queued (6.4ms of work at 10 MB/s), idling 97% of the time between refill ticks. With depth 128, each peer has 2MB queued (200ms of work), fully utilising the 200ms tick interval. Eliminates `final_speed=0.0 MB/s` tail stall observed in all v0.58.1 benchmark trials.
- **In-flight piece cap** — new `max_in_flight_pieces` setting (default 32) bounds store buffer memory at the piece selector level. When the cap is reached, Layers 3 (suggested) and 5 (new piece) are skipped — only partial/steal paths remain active. Memory bound: 32 × 512KB = 16 MiB for typical torrents (was unbounded).

### Added
- `benchmarks/build_report.py` — generates versioned markdown benchmark reports from CSV data
- `benchmarks/generate_report.sh` — orchestrates benchmark summarization and report generation
- `--json` output mode for `benchmarks/summarize.py`
- `docs/benchmark-report-v0.66.0.md` — baseline benchmark report
- `PendingRequests` newtype with full API: `new()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `contains()`, `len()`, `is_empty()`, `clear()`, `iter()`
- `max_in_flight_pieces` setting in `Settings` and `TorrentConfig` (default: 32)
- `cap_reached` field in `PickContext` for piece selector backpressure
- Test count: 1390

## [0.58.1] — Performance Consistency & Tuning

### Fixed
- **Store buffer race causing hash verification failures** — `store_buffer.remove()` was called inside a spawned blocking task, creating a race window where `on_piece_hash_failed()` could trigger re-download and write new blocks before the verify task consumed the old ones, producing "frankenstein pieces" that mixed data from different download attempts (thousands of hash failures per download). Fix: extract blocks synchronously before spawning. Also added `sha1_chunks()`/`sha256_chunks()` for incremental hashing, eliminating ~512KB concatenation allocation per piece verification. Before: 235-300s (4-5 MB/s); After: 35-49s (35-54 MB/s)
- **Store buffer lock scope** — made Mutex lock scope explicit in verify path with block scope, preventing potential contention between enqueue_write and spawn_blocking verify tasks
- **Pipeline fill loop peer validation** — peer existence check and bitfield refresh each iteration of the pick_blocks loop, preventing stale context from causing wasted block picks
- **Disconnect handler re-request guard** — defensive peer existence check before re-requesting blocks from remaining peers after a disconnect
- **Event loop stalls from blocking sends** — all peer channel sends in TorrentActor converted from `.send().await` to `try_send()`, preventing the actor event loop from freezing when any peer channel is full
- **Duplicate block handling** — `handle_piece_data` now returns early when a block was already received, preventing wasted disk writes and double-counting
- **DHT stalled lookups** — `get_peers` queries now advance on timeout instead of stalling; query expiry logging added
- **DHT BEP42 node sorting** — routing table now sorts by XOR distance for correct closest-node selection; all-K parallel `get_peers` queries for faster peer discovery
- **DHT timeout** — reduced from 10s to 5s for faster peer discovery
- **Shutdown hang** — `shutdown_peers()` converted peer shutdown from blocking `.send().await` to `try_send()`; `announce_stopped()` wrapped in 3s timeout; `TorrentHandle::shutdown()` and `SessionHandle::shutdown()` wrapped in 5s/10s timeouts

### Performance
- **Actor CPU overhead reduced** — six targeted optimizations to `request_pieces_from_peer()` and the event loop: skip picker call for duplicate blocks, cache peer_rates on actor (refresh on 1s tick), clone peer bitfield once before picker loop, use `Lengths::chunks_in_piece()` arithmetic instead of iterating chunk tracker, batch-drain up to 64 peer events per `select!` iteration, share single `Instant::now()` call. CPU usage reduced from 3.3x to 1.83x vs rqbit. Before: ~26s user CPU, ~47 MB/s peak; After: ~12.6s user CPU, ~78.5 MB/s peak; rqbit: ~6.9s user CPU, ~105 MB/s peak

### Changed
- **Parallel tracker announces** — all tracker announces now fire concurrently via `tokio::task::JoinSet` instead of sequentially. Time-to-first-piece reduced from `sum(tracker_timeouts)` to `max(tracker_timeouts)`
- **Fixed permit pipeline model** — replaced EWMA-computed queue depth with fixed 128 permits (rqbit model). `queue_depth()` is now constant — zero-latency scheduling with no negative feedback loops
- **End-game pipelining** — end-game mode now sends up to 4 requests per peer (was 1), eliminating the 128x pipeline depth reduction that caused last-3% slowdowns
- **Reactive end-game cancel re-requesting** — when a block is received and duplicate requests are cancelled, freed peers immediately get new end-game blocks instead of waiting for the next tick
- **Snub timeout reduced 60s to 15s** — stalled peers now free their 128 request slots 4x faster; rqbit handles this in ~10s
- **Peer turnover increased from 4%/300s to 8%/120s** — underperforming peers cycled 4x faster (~120 replacements/hour)
- **Zombie peer pruning** — peers with empty bitfields after 30s are disconnected during choking evaluation to free connection slots (only during downloading, not seeding)
- Test count: 1386

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 1.5 GiB, 5 trials)
| Client | Time (s) | CPU (s) | Speed (MB/s) | RSS (MiB) |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| torrent 0.58.1 | 100.3 ±19.3 | 37.1 ±4.7 | 15.0 ±3.5 | 170.2 ±42.9 |
| rqbit 8.1.1 | 34.4 ±24.1 | 10.4 ±0.6 | 56.7 ±27.0 | 37.5 ±3.9 |
| qbittorrent 5.1.4 | 51.5 ±10.7 | 18.1 ±2.5 | 29.1 ±5.3 | 1525.5 ±5.5 |

**Identified bottlenecks for M68:** end-game pipeline depth too shallow (4 vs 128), O(n) linear scans in pending_requests, redundant bitfield clones in hot path, reactive re-requesting triggers 2+ full picker cycles per block, peer_count() does O(n log n) sort per invocation, unbounded store buffer memory

## [0.58.0] — `torrent` v0.58.0: Rename, Non-Blocking Pipeline, Production Hardening

### Breaking
- **Workspace renamed from `ferrite` to `torrent`** — all 12 crates renamed: `ferrite-*` → `torrent-*`. Update your `Cargo.toml` dependencies and `use` imports accordingly.
- Version bumped 0.57.0 → 0.58.0

### Added
- crates.io metadata: keywords, categories, homepage, documentation URLs
- `rust-version = "1.85"` MSRV set for all publishable crates
- Non-blocking disk writes and async piece verification (M58 pipeline re-applied)
- O(1) peer dedup via `HashSet<SocketAddr>` in `handle_add_peers()`
- Criterion benchmarks for bencode parsing and piece hashing
- `rustfmt.toml` with workspace-wide formatting rules
- Workspace-level clippy lint configuration
- Resource exhaustion limits: `max_metadata_size`, `max_message_size`, `max_piece_length`, `max_outstanding_requests`
- `cargo-fuzz` scaffolding with 4 fuzz targets (bencode, peer_wire, tracker, metadata)
- Architecture documentation (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/security.md`)

### Changed
- CLI binary renamed from `ferrite` to `torrent`
- `torrent-cli` marked `publish = false`
- Test count: 1378+

## [0.57.0] — TCP Listener, UPnP Gateway Probe & Log Cleanup

### Fixed
- **TCP listener for incoming peer connections** — `SessionActor` only had uTP and SSL listeners, never binding a plain TCP accept loop on the main listen port. Incoming TCP connections were refused, preventing peers from connecting to us. Added TCP listener bind, generalized `identify_plaintext_connection` to any `AsyncRead+AsyncWrite` stream, and unified routing via `route_inbound_stream<S>`
- **UPnP discovery with gateway probe fallback** — many consumer routers have broken SSDP (don't respond to multicast M-SEARCH) but serve valid UPnP descriptions over HTTP. Added fallback that probes the default gateway on common UPnP ports (49152, 5000, 5431, 2869, 49153) and description paths (`/rootDesc.xml`, `/gatedesc.xml`, etc.)
- **UPnP IGD v2 support** — SSDP now sends both v1 and v2 M-SEARCH, and service type search includes `WANIPConnection:2` alongside v1 and `WANPPPConnection:1` (PPPoE)
- **SSDP response filtering** — discovery loop now skips non-IGD responders (e.g. Plex DLNA servers) and accepts only `InternetGatewayDevice` matches
- **Log spam reduced** — demoted routine peer churn events (uTP max timeouts, wire errors, send errors) from `warn!` to `debug!`

### Changed
- `identify_plaintext_connection` generalized from `UtpStream`-specific to generic `S: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin + Send`
- `TorrentCommand::IncomingPeer` now carries `BoxedStream` instead of `PrefixedStream<UtpStream>`
- `BoxedStream` now implements `Debug`
- Test count: 1378

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 1.5 GiB, with UPnP port mapping)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Peak 5s speed | 56.0 MB/s |
| Average speed | 29.4 MB/s |
| Peak unchoked | 156 peers |
| Total peers | 200 |

## [0.56.1] — Settings Wiring & Throughput Fixes

### Fixed
- **13 TorrentConfig fields now wired from Settings** — `upload_rate_limit`, `download_rate_limit`, `strict_end_game`, `max_web_seeds`, `initial_picker_threshold`, `whole_pieces_threshold`, `snub_timeout_secs`, `readahead_pieces`, and `streaming_timeout_escalation` were hardcoded in `From<&Settings>`, silently ignoring user configuration
- **4 new TorrentConfig fields** — `storage_mode`, `block_request_timeout_secs`, `enable_lsd`, `force_proxy` now flow from Settings to per-torrent config
- **Storage mode wired to disk** — `FilesystemStorage::new()` preallocate parameter now respects `StorageMode::Full` instead of always being `false`
- **MSE PadB handling** — VC scan was broken for all real peers (desynchronized RC4 cipher on unencrypted padding)
- **uTP ext type 3** — libtorrent close_reason extension caused parse failures

### Performance
- **TorrentActor unblocked** — all peer command broadcasts converted from `.send().await` (blocking) to `try_send()` (non-blocking), preventing deadlocks on bounded channels
- **Phantom block assignments eliminated** — `assigned_blocks.insert()` moved after `try_send().is_ok()`, preventing permanent piece stalls when send fails
- **Snub detection** — peers marked as snubbed after 60s of no data while unchoked, freeing their assigned blocks
- **Pipeline tick** — `PeerPipelineState::tick()` now called every 1s for EWMA throughput updates

### Added
- 7 new Settings fields: `strict_end_game`, `max_web_seeds`, `initial_picker_threshold`, `whole_pieces_threshold`, `snub_timeout_secs`, `readahead_pieces`, `streaming_timeout_escalation`
- Regression test with non-default Settings values to prevent re-hardcoding

### Changed
- Test count: 1376 (was under-reported as 1153 due to `--fail-fast` hiding 4 crates behind pre-existing sim test failure)

## [0.56.0] — M56: Speed Optimization

### Added
- **DHT routing table persistence** — saves DHT routing table nodes on shutdown and reloads on startup for instant peer discovery (eliminates cold-start penalty)
- **Piece stealing** — faster peers steal in-flight blocks from peers running at less than 1/10th their download rate (configurable `steal_threshold_ratio`, default 10.0)
- **`initial_queue_depth`** setting — configurable per-peer initial request pipeline depth (default: 128, embedded: 16, high_performance: 256)
- **`steal_threshold_ratio`** setting — configurable steal aggressiveness (default: 10.0, high_performance: 5.0)
- **`dht_saved_nodes`** runtime field — builder API for injecting saved DHT nodes before session start

### Changed
- **Initial pipeline queue depth** raised from 2 to 128 per peer — matches rqbit's semaphore-permit model for faster ramp-up
- **PeerState::new()** now accepts configurable pipeline parameters instead of hardcoded values
- **Session state** now populates `dht_nodes` field (previously always empty `Vec::new()`)

### CLI
- **DHT state persistence** — `ferrite download` saves/loads DHT routing table to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ferrite/session.dat` across runs

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 1.42 GiB, 3 trials)
| Client | Time (s) | Speed (MB/s) | RSS (MiB) |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| ferrite | 96.8 ±1.1 | 15.0 ±0.2 | 29.3 ±0.9 |
| rqbit | 17.1 ±0.6 | 84.9 ±2.8 | 42.3 ±1.7 |
| libtorrent | 32.7 ±0.7 | 44.4 ±0.9 | 1487.8 ±0.1 |

**Note:** No speed improvement observed — the primary bottleneck is in the transfer pipeline itself (not peer discovery, queue depth, or block assignment). DHT persistence saves 40 nodes per session. Further investigation needed for M57.

## [0.55.0] — M55: Download Speed Optimization

### Changed
- **Immediate peer connection** — DHT, PEX, tracker, and manually-added peers now trigger `try_connect_peers()` immediately instead of waiting up to 30s for the periodic connect timer
- **Raised default max_peers** from 50 to 200 per torrent
- **Reduced connect_interval** from 30s to 5s for faster catch-up on edge cases
- **`max_peers_per_torrent`** now configurable in Settings (default: 200, embedded: 30, high_performance: 500)

### Fixed
- **CLI: FilesystemStorage** — `ferrite download` was passing `None` for storage, causing the session to use MemoryStorage (in-RAM only). Now creates proper FilesystemStorage from torrent metadata.

### Benchmark (Arch ISO 1.42 GiB, 3 trials)
| Client | Time (s) | Speed (MB/s) | RSS (MiB) |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| ferrite | 87.7 ±3.6 | 16.6 ±0.7 | 27.6 ±0.8 |
| rqbit | 17.8 ±0.9 | 81.5 ±3.9 | 40.6 ±0.9 |
| libtorrent | 37.1 ±29.9 | 58.2 ±37.9 | 1487.1 ±0.3 |

**Note:** Remaining speed gap is due to DHT cold-start (no routing table persistence). See M56 roadmap.

## [0.54.0] — M54: CLI Binary & Benchmarking

### Added
- **`ferrite-cli` crate** — new workspace member providing the `ferrite` binary
- **`ferrite download`** — download torrents from magnet links or .torrent files with indicatif progress bar, Ctrl-C graceful shutdown, `--config` JSON settings, `--seed`, `--quiet`, `--no-dht`, `--port` options

- **Piece queries**: `have_piece`, `piece_availability`, `file_progress` with byte-accurate file-piece overlap
- **Identity queries**: `info_hashes`, `torrent_file`, `torrent_file_v2` (None for magnets before metadata)
- **Force announce**: `force_dht_announce` (dual-swarm v4/v6), `force_lsd_announce` (session-level)
- **Disk operations**: `read_piece` → `Bytes`, `flush_cache` with `DiskJob::FlushAll`
- **Niche operations**: `is_valid` (synchronous), `clear_error` (auto-resume), `file_status`, `connect_peer`
- **TorrentFlags**: bitflags convenience API (PAUSED, AUTO_MANAGED, SEQUENTIAL_DOWNLOAD, SUPER_SEEDING, UPLOAD_ONLY)
- **Alerts**: `FileCompleted`, `MetadataFailed`, `ExternalIpDetected`
- **Types**: `PeerInfo`, `PartialPieceInfo`, `FileMode`, `FileStatus`, `TorrentFlags`
- `TokenBucket::rate()` getter

### Fixed
